**Outline**
- Train vs plane for holidays
- Urban transportation efficiency
- American cities and large scale car use, induced demand
- Why the future won't be like the news says

## Points

**Plane vs Train**:
- most of the time, there is no real choice, it's either one or the other
	- distance
	- cost
- biggest problems of trains:
	- lack of standardisation between countries
	- no shared ticketing system
	- lack of improvements due to oligopolies or imperfect competition
- biggest problems of planes: 
	- co2 emissions
	- cost
	- buffer time (getting on and off)

**Transportation in europe**:
- diverse methods of travel
	- tram, metro, bus, bike, on foot
- cities are built for people and not cars
	- there is usually a shop in walking distance of you
- cities developed naturally
	- everything was built where it was needed and people concentrated around centers

**Transportation in the US**:
- no freedom of choice: you have to own a car
- the cities are built for cars
	- massive freeways and interchanges built right through cities
	- massive parking lots (8 spaces per car in the US)
	- suburbia style cities are heavily divided
		- living; schools and offices; shopping
		- everything is sepparated by kilometers and only connected by highways
- the americas used to have streetcars, but replaced them with buses and then replaced buses wih cars
	- this was allegedly part of a conspiracy by the big five of the automobile industry
	- by marketing cars as freedom to the american people, the car became a symbol of freedom that actually took away their freedom
